idyllium by kearnie lin.

from the start, i intended my project to be handled by a UI of buttons that
subsequently toggled certain attributes that the user would control. 
because of earlier coding practices and convenience, i handled a lot of the 
manipulation through arbitrary keypresses (also because i did not learn
pygame enough yet to implement interactables and mousepresses); however,
because i did not want the user to have to press so many different keys, 
i limited the keyboard to just the up and down arrow keys, but depending
on the button that was toggled, do different things. so essentially, the up
key can now increase light concentration, increase rain/snow pour, or increase
temperature. i aligned the buttons on the top right, out of the way of the 
main interface, and included what i thought were notable details on the top 
left, such as temperature (to determine leaf color, falling chances, and
type of precipitation), and the windspeed and direction (which changes the 
paths of falling leaves). 

i handled these from the advice of students from the project-sharing event
during tuesday's lecture, who all preferred a less complicated user experience
for handling the environment changes. althought i just was not finished on
tuesday yet, they also suggested me make a help and splash screen so that the
user can know which things to control and how rather than me vocally 
instructing them.
