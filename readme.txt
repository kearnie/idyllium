idyllium by kearnie lin. 

my project is a virtual, visual and aesthetic-based environment which the 
user can manipulate; the basis is an upscrolling camera panning of a tree, and 
the user can control the weather's attributes (light concentration, 
precipitation, temperature, day/nighttime cycles)

the user needs to have pygame and numpy, as well as all the necessary 
images (icons/buttons) and audio, which are included in the assets.
